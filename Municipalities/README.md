# Municipalities chloropleth map plot script

This script contains a template to plot Finnish municipalities (as of 2017) as a chloropleth map. Below is an example where I have only plotted discrete values over municipalities. This is template is easy to modify for plotting also continuous data. 

Some user discretion is advised as Finnish municipalities' borders are far from static.
