# Countries of the world chloropleth map plot script

This script uses geojson data of the borders of all the countries of the world to plot a chosen indicator. Using the script, it is easy to visualize clearly and efficiently any given data on country level. 

Below is an example of the map of the world depicting the etymology of different countries' capitals' names. In my opinion, it turned out pretty funny and informative.

I have included also another map that is slightly more fundamental.

It is easy to construct any indicator (discrete or continuous) given the example data set included. I've also made the modification of a desired colormap as easy as possible. The examples above use high contrast color pairs for clarity.
